Everything that was required was acheived in this lab, as all the programs work.

Question 1) --------------------- 

1. The first recursive call will be towers(4,2,1)

2. It takes 5 invocations before the first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation.

3. It will print "Move #1: From Tower 2 to Tower 3".

4. The second recursive call will be towers(3,2,3)


Question 2) --------------------- 

There are 255 lines. This is known by modifying the program to count the number of lines.
